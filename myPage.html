                <span>My name is Erlan Isaev. I am a third year student at IITU University. I am the most ordinary guy, trying to be optimistic about life. I would like to become strong, successful and confident. I can’t say anything about creating a family, as I am now more focused on studying. I believe that it is necessary to provide a solid material base, and then think about it.

                    I want to create an interface for an adviser where he can watch his students. There will be elements of communication, that is, if a student has any problems, he will be able to send a video, photo or message. Since this interface will be developed for the university and in theory it will be used in practice, all information will be viewed, that is, communication will be held there only on university topics and so on. Special notes should be made, such as "urgent", in which the adviser will be notified via mail and notifications.
